## 📊 Data Sources

This project uses the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**, which includes information about sleep duration, quality, and various lifestyle factors.

🔗 [Kaggle: Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

### Dataset Includes:

* Demographics (age, gender)
* Occupation
* Sleep metrics (duration, quality)
* Physical activity levels
* Stress levels
* BMI category
* Blood pressure
* Heart rate
* Daily steps
* Sleep disorders

## 🔄 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Exploration** – Understand the dataset’s structure
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing data and anomalies
3. **Feature Engineering** – Derive useful features
4. **Correlation Analysis** – Identify important factors
5. **Clustering** – Discover sleep pattern groups
6. **Predictive Modeling** – Build models to predict sleep quality
7. **Recommendation System** – Generate personalized advice
8. **Dashboard** – Visualize findings interactively

## ✨ Key Features

* 📊 Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
* 📈 Sleep quality visualization by demographic and occupation
* 💼 Occupation-wise sleep quality comparisons
* 🏃‍♂️ Activity and stress impact analysis
* 🛌 Sleep disorder insights
* 🤖 Machine learning prediction of sleep quality
* 🎯 Personalized improvement recommendations

## 💻 Usage

### ▶️ Run the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser to view the dashboard. You can:

* Visualize sleep quality trends
* Filter data by age, gender, BMI
* View correlations and distributions
* Get predictions and tailored recommendations

### 📓 Open the Analysis Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/sleep_health_analysis.ipynb
```

Explore:

* Data cleaning and wrangling
* Visual EDA and clustering
* Machine learning model development
* Feature importance analysis

## 📈 Results

Key insights include:

1. **Occupational Impact**: Doctors and engineers report the highest sleep quality (8+/10); scientists have the lowest (\~5/10).
2. **Stress Correlation**: A strong inverse correlation (-0.89) exists between stress and sleep quality.
3. **Sleep Clusters**:

   * **Cluster 0**: High quality, optimal sleep
   * **Cluster 1**: Moderate quality, slightly short duration
   * **Cluster 2**: Poor quality, disrupted sleep
4. **Physical Activity**: Moderate activity improves sleep; excessive levels don't enhance it further.
5. **Sleep Disorders**: Conditions like apnea and insomnia heavily degrade sleep quality.
6. **Top Predictors**: Stress level, duration, and physical activity most strongly affect sleep quality.
